👨 About me
<br>
<br>

As a Junior Full-Stack Developer with a background in Mechanical Engineering (Master's degree), I bring a unique blend of technical expertise and problem-solving skills to the table. Graduating from Le Wagon's intensive Web Development Bootcamp has equipped me with a solid foundation in both front-end and back-end development.

During my time at Le Wagon, I actively engaged in various collaborative group projects, each presenting unique challenges and opportunities for growth. Among these, I contributed significantly to the development of a website for renting electric cars and an app catering to movie enthusiasts, among others. These projects not only honed my technical skills but also showcased my ability to thrive in a team environment and deliver results.

With a keen eye for detail and a passion for continuous learning, I am eager to leverage my diverse skill set to tackle new challenges and make meaningful contributions to innovative projects in the field of full-stack development.

Don't hesitate to contact me at any time！ :-)
